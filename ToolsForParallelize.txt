Parallel Inspector
Threading analysis inspector and data races

* Run Intel Parallel Inspector
cd /opt/intel/inspector_xe_2016/bin64
./inpecxe-gui

Intel Parallel Advisor
Helps programmers decide where to parallelize their code, and whether the resulting performance gain will be worth the effort
also improves reliability by identifying memory errors and threading errors.

* Run Intel Parallel Advisor
cd /opt/intel/advisor_xe_2016/bin64
./advixe-gui

Intel VTune Amplifier
Is a performance profiler that analyzes hotspots, concurrency and locks-and-waits.

* Run VTune Amplifier
cd /opt/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe_2016.2.0.444464/bin64
./amplxe-gui

* Analysis
-Bottom-up: Helps to check which functions are spending much time in execution.
P = Porcentaje del programa paralelizable
Porcentaje Serial = 1 - P
Tp = Porcentaje Serial + (P/#Procesadores)
Aceleracion = A = 1/Tp

To initialize any of the above programs part of parallel Amplifier in linux - Ubuntu:
Change kernel variable:
/proc/sys/kernel/yama
echo 0 | sudo tee ptrace_scope
