# MachineLearningAlgorithms

The main objective of this repo is to have a library of different machine learning algorithms.
ANN, Fuzzy logic, Clustering and Genetic Algorithms.

Every file has its compilation instructions and sometimes th project will have a branch where the
algorithm is parallelized through OpenMp library

Feel free to do any changes.
